# Work-Related Fatality Study: Comprehensive Analysis

## Introduction

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of work-related fatalities, employing a combination of Python and SQL. The primary aim was to derive valuable insights from the provided dataset. Additionally, I utilized Tableau for data visualization to enhance the presentation of findings.

## Dataset Preparation

### Data Review
I meticulously reviewed the dataset, focusing on columns pertinent to work-related fatalities. This step allowed me to gain a comprehensive understanding of the available data.

### Data Cleaning
Recognizing the significance of data quality, I emphasized data cleaning. I removed unnecessary columns and addressed any inconsistencies or missing values, ensuring that the dataset was well-prepared for further analysis.

## Data Analysis

### Python Analysis
I harnessed the power of Python, particularly Pandas, to conduct various data analyses. Python's libraries enabled me to explore the dataset efficiently, uncovering patterns and trends in work-related fatalities.

## SQL Queries

### Addressing Specific Questions
To provide structured insights, I formulated SQL queries to address specific questions. Notable queries included calculating the number of reported incidents and identifying the top states with the most fatalities arising from specific causes, such as shootings or stabbings.

## Data Visualization with Tableau

### Enhancing Presentation
To augment the impact of the analysis, I leveraged Tableau for data visualization. This dynamic tool allowed me to create interactive and visually compelling representations of the findings. These visualizations serve as a valuable means of conveying insights to a wider audience.
